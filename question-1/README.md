# Question 1
To create a basic static webpage, we will need to create a file labelled `index.html`. This file will need to have a HTML 5 template. We can do so by typing in `html:5` in Visual Studio Code (VSC) where it will suggest the `Emmet Abbreviation` for a HTML 5 template. Press the `tab` key on your keyboard where it will populate the template for you. 

Using what was explained above, create a HTML file with a HTML 5 template. You do not need to write anything else in it.
