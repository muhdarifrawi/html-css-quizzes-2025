# Question 18
A webpage just like any other known medium, would require a form of 
units of measurement. They generally are split into two types:
- Absolute Measurements
    - Depends on itself and not parent nor references.
- Relative Measurements
    - Will require either a parent measurement or a reference.

<br/>

The simplest demonstration is to do the following:
- Create a `div` element with an `id` attribute named `unit`.
- Write the following script using the new `id` as the selector:
    - background-color: salmon;
    - height: 200px;
    - width: 60vw;

<br/>

Try resizing your browswer's width and watch what happens to the width of the `div`.
