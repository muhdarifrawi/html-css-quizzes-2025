# Question 8
You can provide links in webpages to route users into any other relevant pages. 

If you wish to link them out of your webpage, and into another website, you can use absolute paths for that. If you would like to navigate them to the next page of your website, you can use a relative path.

Create the following:
- a. A link that leads to Google 
- b. A link that navigates user to `about.html`
- c. A link that navigates user back to `index.html`
