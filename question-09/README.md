# Question 9
The `div` element is a block level element. 

The `span` element is an inline level element. 

They are primarily used as a way to group elements together. In their default state, they do not have any height to them.

To demonstrate their behaviours, do the following:
- Create a `div` element with a content text "This is a div.'
- Create 3 `span` elements with a content "span 1", "span 2" and "span 3".
- Create another `div` element after them with the content txt "This is another div"
