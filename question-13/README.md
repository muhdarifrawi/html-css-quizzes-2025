# Question 13
`id` attributes are one of the ways to create unique selectors for CSS. They should only exist once in a single file.

For example:
```HTML
<div id="section-1">
    ...
</div>
<div id="section-2">
    ...
</div>
<div id="section-3">
    ...
</div>
```

Create 3 `div` elements each with the following `id`: `area-1`, `area-2`, `area-3`.

Give each of them a different height and background colour.
