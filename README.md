# HTML CSS Quizzes 2025
## Introduction
These are short questions for you to try out some basic HTML/CSS practices. Do try them out and see how well you fare. Do feel free to ask any questions you may have about them.

## Using the Repository
Please `fork` the repository into your account before attempting the questions. Forking the repo will allow you to have a copy of it on your own account. This will also prevent you from accidentally editing this master copy. 

## How to answer the questions
The questions are organised into folder. Each folder will contain a `README` file that has the questions on them. Most question folder will also contain a base template unless the question requires you to make them yourself.
