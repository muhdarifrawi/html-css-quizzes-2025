# Question 14
Using `class` attributes can help in grouping the selectors for CSS. Classes, unlike ID, can be reused
for any relevant elements. They also can be stacked. 

For example:
```html
<div class="info another-info draws">
    ...
</div>
<div class="info draws">
    ...
</div>
```

Create 2 `class` attributes. 
One `class` should have the following declaration : `color: salmon;`, 
and the other `class` should have `height:200px; width:200px;`


Use the 2 newly create class to create a `div` element with both class present.
